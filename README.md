## What is KnightOS?

It's freely available in both source and binary forms under the terms of the MIT license.
With KnightOS, you get an unmatched level of freedom and customization over your calculator.

## Why KnightOS

If you choose to use KnightOS, you get more memory to play with, more space for your files, and loads of great features.
KnightOS has a package manager for easy installation of software and can run several things at once.
If you're into free and open-source software, you'll also find KnightOS to be a hacker's paradise.

## Can I use KnightOS?

KnightOS will run on any upgradable Texas Instruments calculator based on the z80 CPU.
This includes the TI-73, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, TI-84+, TI-84+ Silver Edition, and TI-84+ Color Silver Edition.
You can also run it on the French variations of these calculators, or in an emulator.
